## Versioning

The version numbers of Fluent Assertions releases comply to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme. In other words, release 1.4.0 only adds backwards-compatible functionality and bug fixes compared to 1.3.0. Release 1.4.1 should only include bug fixes. And if we ever introduce breaking changes, the number increased to 2.0.0.

## What do you need to compile the solution?

* Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 or later
* Windows 8.1
* The Windows Phone 8 SDK
