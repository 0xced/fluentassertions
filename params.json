We currently use it in all our internal and client projects, and it is used in many open-source projects. It runs on the following frameworks:\r\n\r\n* .NET 4.0 and 4.5\r\n* Windows Store Apps for Windows 8 and 8.1\r\n* Silverlight 5\r\n* Windows Phone 8.1\r\n* Windows Phone Silverlight 8.0 and 8.1\r\n* Portable Class Libraries\r\n \r\nIt supports the following unit test frameworks:\r\n\r\n* MSTest (Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 and Visual Studio 2013)\r\n* [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)\r\n* [XUnit](http://xunit.codeplex.com/)\r\n* [XUnit2](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/releases)\r\n* [MBUnit](http://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/)\r\n* [Gallio](http://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/)\r\n* [NSpec](http://nspec.org/)\r\n* [MSpec](https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications)\r\n\r\nThe releases are available as a zipped download in the [Releases](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/fluentassertions/releases) section or as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentAssertions).\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n----\r\nNothing is more annoying than a unit test that fails without clearly explaining why. More than often, you need to set a breakpoint and start up the debugger to be able to figure out what went wrong. Jeremy D. Miller once gave the advice to [\"keep out of the debugger hell\"](http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2005/08/18/testing-granularity-feedback-cycles-and-holistic-development/) and I can only agree with that.\r\n\r\nFor instance, only test a single condition per test case. If you don't, and the first condition fails, the test engine will not even try to test the other conditions. But if any of the others fail, you'll be on your own to figure out which one. I often run into this problem when developers try to combine multiple related tests that test a member using different parameters into one test case. If you really need to do that, consider using a parameterized test that is being called by several clearly named test cases.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we designed Fluent Assertions to help you in this area. Not only by using clearly named assertion methods, but also by making sure the failure message provides as much information as possible. Consider this example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\"1234567890\".Should().Be(\"0987654321\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be reported as: \r\n    \r\n\tExpected string to be\r\n\t\"0987654321\", but\r\n\t\"1234567890\" differs near \"123\" (index 0).\r\n\r\nThe fact that both strings are displayed on a separate line is not a coincidence and happens if any of them is longer than 8 characters. However, if that's not enough, all assertion methods take an optional explanation (the *because*) that supports formatting placeholders similar to `String.Format` which you can use to enrich the failure message. For instance, the assertion\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnew[] { 1, 2, 3 }.Should().Contain(item => item > 3, \"at least {0} item should be larger than 3\", 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail with: \r\n\r\n\tCollection {1, 2, 3} should have an item matching (item > 3) because at least 1 item should be larger than 3.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\nTo verify that a string begins, ends and contains a particular phrase.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nstring actual = \"ABCDEFGHI\";\r\nactual.Should().StartWith(\"AB\").And.EndWith(\"HI\").And.Contain(\"EF\").And.HaveLength(9);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo verify that a collection contains a specified number of elements and that all elements match a predicate.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nIEnumerable collection = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };\r\ncollection.Should().HaveCount(4, \"because we thought we put three items in the collection\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about the second failing example is that it will throw an exception with the message \r\n\r\n\t\"Expected <4> items because we thought we put three items in the collection, but found <3>.\" \r\n\t\r\nTo verify that a particular business rule is enforced using exceptions.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar recipe = new RecipeBuilder()\r\n   .With(new IngredientBuilder().For(\"Milk\").WithQuantity(200, Unit.Milliliters))\r\n   .Build();\r\n\r\nAction action = () => recipe.AddIngredient(\"Milk\", 100, Unit.Spoon);\r\n\r\naction\r\n   .ShouldThrow<RuleViolationException>()\r\n   .WithMessage(\"change the unit of an existing ingredient\", ComparisonMode.Substring)\r\n   .And.Violations.Should().Contain(BusinessRule.CannotChangeIngredientQuanity);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne neat feature is the ability to chain a specific assertion on top of an assertion that acts on a collection or graph of objects. \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ndictionary.Should().ContainValue(myClass).Which.SomeProperty.Should().BeGreaterThan(0);\r\n\r\nsomeObject.Should().BeOfType<Exception>().Which.Message.Should().Be(\"Other Message\");\r\n\r\nxDocument.Should().HaveElement(\"child\").Which.Should().BeOfType<XElement>().And.HaveAttribute(\"attr\", \"1\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've run into quite a few of these scenarios in which this chaining would make the unit test a lot easier to read. \r\n\r\nAbout versioning\r\n----------------\r\nThe version numbers of Fluent Assertions releases comply to the Semantic Versioning scheme. In other words, release 1.4.0 only adds backwards-compatible functionality and bug fixes compared to 1.3.0. Release 1.4.1 should only include bug fixes. And if we ever introduce breaking changes, the number increased to 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nWhat do you need to compile the solution?\r\n-----------------------------\r\n* Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 or later\r\n* Windows 8.1\r\n* The Windows Phone 8 SDK\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n-----------\r\nWe are a bunch of developers working for Aviva Solutions who highly value software quality, in particular \r\n- [Dennis Doomen](https://twitter.com/ddoomen)  \r\n- [Martin Opdam](https://twitter.com/mpopdam) \r\n\r\nNotable contributors from the last couple of months include\r\n- [Adam Voss](https://github.com/vossad01)\r\n\r\nThe [Xamarin](https://github.com/onovotny/fluentassertions) version has been built by\r\n- [Oren Novotny](https://twitter.com/onovotny)\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments or suggestions, please let us know via [twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=fluentassertions&src=typd), through the [issues](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/FluentAssertions/issues) page, or through [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fluent-assertions).\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks\r\n--------------\r\nThis project would not have been possible without the support of [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/).
